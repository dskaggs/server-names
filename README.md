# Server Naming Assistant

## About This Tool

There's an old saying in technology circles that says "naming things is hard". 
Network administrators and architects face this issue every time they need to 
configure a new server or create a new virtual machine. There are many opinions 
on naming schemes; from using element names from the periodic table, to characters from your favorite television series and beyond.

Several years ago I ran across a [blog post](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/proper-server-naming-scheme) by Manuel Weiss detailing a scheme that I really liked. The basis of this scheme is a word list of 1626 words specifically selected for use as server names.

This simple application is designed to be a way to quickly view and filter that word list when needing a name for a new server or VM.

## Motivation
This is a learning application for me as I've been out of front end development for several years and am trying to refresh my skills by building this simple application. So if you see something I've done completely wrong, I'm happy to take constructive criticism to make it better and learn things.
